codeforces.com competition, 883 for division 3.

For this competition I completed 5/8 problems successfully which I am pretty pleased with, I think I did well.

I solved A, B, C, D and E1. E2 I got a stuck on, I tried skipping past it but couldn't do F or G either. I feel like I got really close to E2 but got stuck on something and couldn't finish.
