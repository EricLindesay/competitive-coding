[Problem Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/25/problem/A)  

Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given ``n`` numbers differs from the others. Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness. Help Bob — to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given ``n`` numbers finds one that is different in evenness.  
  
### Input
The first line contains integer ``n`` (`3 ≤ `n` ≤ 100`) — amount of numbers in the task. The second line contains ``n`` space-separated natural numbers, not exceeding 100. It is guaranteed, that exactly one of these numbers differs from the others in evenness.  
  
### Output
Output index of number that differs from the others in evenness. Numbers are numbered from 1 in the input order.  

### Examples
```
Input
5 
2 4 7 8 10
Output 
3
```
```
Input
4
1 2 1 1
Output
2
```
