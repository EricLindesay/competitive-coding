## Problem
[Problem Link](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1542/B)  

There is an infinite set generated as follows:  

- `1` is in this set. 
- If `x` is in this set, `x * a` and `x+b` both are in this set. 
For example, when `a=3` and `b=6`, the five smallest elements of the set are:  

- `1`, 
- `3` (`1` is in this set, so `1* a=3` is in this set), 
- `7` (`1` is in this set, so `1+b=7` is in this set), 
- `9` (`3` is in this set, so `3* a=9` is in this set), 
- `13` (`7` is in this set, so `7+b=13` is in this set). 
Given positive integers `a`, `b`, `n`, determine if `n` is in this set.  
  
### Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer `t` (`1<= t<= 10^5`) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.  

The only line describing each test case contains three integers `n`, `a`, `b` (`1<= n,a,b<= 10^9`) separated by a single space.  
  
### Output
For each test case, print "`Yes`" if `n` is in this set, and "`No`" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case.

### Examples
```
Input
5
24 3 5
10 3 6
2345 1 4
19260817 394 485
19260817 233 264
Output
Yes
No
Yes
No
Yes
```

### Note  
In the first test case, `24` is generated as follows:  

- `1` is in this set, so `3` and `6` are in this set; 
- `3` is in this set, so `9` and `8` are in this set; 
- `8` is in this set, so `24` and `13` are in this set. 
Thus we can see `24` is in this set.  

The five smallest elements of the set in the second test case is described in statements. We can see that `10` isn't among them.


## Solution

### Brute Force
We shouldn't look from 1 up to the number, we should do it in reverse, it makes it easier to stop routes which you know will fail.  
We can do this using recursion, if you do recursion on both `n/a` and `n-b` then we can go until we either get 1 or we get something invalid (like a fraction or a negative number).  
We can also reduce the number of loops by checking if `(n-1)%b == 0`. If this is true, we know that n is in the range since it can be achieved by just adding `b`s.  
Additionally we can check if `n` is a power of `a`. If it is, then you can just achieve `n` by multiplying by `a`s.  

This is giving me seg faults. I think its because the program is running out of memory.
