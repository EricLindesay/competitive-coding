# Code Wars
This repo contains most of the [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) coding challenges I have done.  

Code Wars difficulty is ranked from 8kyu (easiest) to 1kyu (hardest).
Not all of these challenges have my thought process explained because I did them before implementing the READMEs.

I should consider doing separate branches for each challenge and then merging it together when the challenge is completed.
Will make it easier to keep track of which challenges I need to go back to.

## C++
I feel the need to note about C++.  
I have just started learning the language so am quite bad at it, explaining why the code is bad and the problems are easy for it.
