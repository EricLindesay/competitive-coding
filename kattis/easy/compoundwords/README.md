### Description

Write a program that reads a list of words from standard   input and prints out a sorted list of all unique compound words   that can be made by concatenating two different words from the   input list. If the same compound word can be formed more than   one way, it should only be listed once in the output.

### Input
Input is a list of `1`   to `100` words separated   by whitespace (spaces and / or newlines). There may be more   than one word on each input line. Each word is a sequence of at   most `10` lowercase   English letters (aâ€“z). Input ends at end of file.

### Output
Your program should print out all unique compound words, one   per line. They should be printed in sorted (dictionary)   order.

### Examples
```
Input
a bb
ab b
Output
aab
ab
aba
abb
abbb
ba
bab
bba
bbab
bbb
```
