## Problem
[Problem link](https://open.kattis.com/problems/quadrant)

### Description
A common problem in mathematics is to determine which quadrant a given point lies in. There are four quadrants, numbered from `1` to
`4`.

Your job is to take a point and determine the quadrant it is in. You can assume that neither of the two coordinates will be `0`.

### Input
The first line of input contains the integer `x (-1000 <= x <= 1000; x != 0)`. The second line of input contains the integer `y  (-1000 <= y <= 1000; y != 0)`.

### Output
Output the quadrant number for the point.

### Examples
```
Input
10
6
Output
1
```
```
Input
9
-13
Output
4
```
