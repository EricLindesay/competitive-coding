### Description

Oh no! Chalmers Challenge is only one day away and Chalmers Coding Club havenâ€™t had the time to prepare all tasks. As we all know, competitive programming problems are created by combining funny problem statements with computer programming methods. There are `A_{uniq}+A_{reuse}` problem statement themes and `B_{uniq}+B_{reuse}` algorithmic methods. Some of these are one-trick ponies that only work once while others are so good they never get old. Out of all the themes and methods, only `A_{reuse}` and `B_{reuse}` are good enough to be reused continually. How many different problems can be created by combining all these themes and methods?

### Input
Input consists of one line with four space-separated integers: `0 <= A_{uniq}, B_{uniq}, A_{reuse}, B_{reuse} <= 10^9`, the number of single-use themes and methods and the number of reusable themes and methods respectively.

### Output
Output a single integer, the number of problems that can be created in total. 

### Examples
```
Input
2 3 0 0
Output
2

Input
7 3 0 3
Output
