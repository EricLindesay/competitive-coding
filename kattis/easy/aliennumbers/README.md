### Description

The decimal numeral system is composed of ten digits, which we represent as "0123456789" (the digits in a system are written from lowest to highest). Imagine you have discovered an alien numeral system composed of some number of digits, which may or may not be the same as those used in decimal. For example, if the alien numeral system were represented as "oF8", then the numbers one through ten would be (F, 8, Fo, FF, F8, 8o, 8F, 88, Foo, FoF). We would like to be able to work with numbers in arbitrary alien systems. More generally, we want to be able to convert an arbitrary number thatâ€™s written in one alien system into a second alien system.

### Input
The first line of input gives the number of cases, `T<= 100`. `T` test cases follow. Each case is a line formatted as alien_number source_language target_language Each language will be represented by a list of its digits, ordered from lowest to highest value. No digit will be repeated in any representation, all digits in the alien number will be present in the source language, and the first digit of the alien number will not be the lowest valued digit of the source language (in other words, the alien numbers have no leading zeroes). Each digit will either be a number 0-9, an uppercase or lowercase letter, or one of the following symbols !"#%&$()*+,-./:;<>?@[\\]^_`{}~
You may assume that the number in decimal is positive and at most 1000000000. All languages will have at most 94 digits.

### Output
For each test case, output one line containing "Case #`x`: " followed by the alien number translated from the source language to the target language. 

### Examples
```
Input
4
9 0123456789 oF8
Foo oF8 0123456789
13 0123456789abcdef 01
CODE O!CDE? A?JM!.

Output
Case #1: Foo
Case #2: 9
Case #3: 10011
Case #4: JAM!
```


## Solution
This was a very interesting problem. It was deceptively difficult, despite only being easy.  

First things first, I created a map from character to index for the source and target languages. This just allows me to easily get index from character or character from index (using the original string).  

Then, I went through the alien number and for each character, converted that character into the index the character is in the language string. Essentially, converting the alien number into base `src.length()`.

Then, I converted that string into decimal. Then converted that result into the "other base" which is base `target.length()`.

Then, I used that resulting string (containing integers representing the characters) into the actual characters and printed each character.

I didn't think this would be fast enough but it was.

Solved!

### Minor optimisations
I then did some minor optimisations, removing unnecessary code.  
I removed:
- The target character -> index map, it was unused as took `O(target.length())`.
- The code which converted the alien number into base `src.length()`. Instead of doing a for loop here, I just directly pass the map in when converting it to decimal. Meaning that `O(num.length())` is saved.
- Passed by reference into functions meaning that C++ doesn't have to copy the memory.

An easy way to make this program faster is to convert directly from base `src.length()` to base `target.length()` but I'm not sure how you would go about doing that.
